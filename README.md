# Flipper
### What is Flipper? ###

Flipper is an open-source PDF library written in Scala and that can be integrated in any Java/Scala environment developed by the good people at Growin. It has some really usefull features such as: 
* **Parsing a PDF document and returning a JSON object** - Flipper is able to parse the text in a PDF document,
 as well as recognize text in images inside the PDF document,
 and return a JSON object with the extracted information. You simply specify the type of value you want to obtain
 for a given keyword (A noun, a verb, a number etc.), and Flipper will do the rest!
 
 * **Convert JSON to PDF** - Flipper does not content it self with just parsing a PDF file, that's easy!
 Flipper also converts a given JSON object to a PDF document. You can also customize the outputted document
 with CSS.
 
 * **Convert PDF to other file types** - We also support the conversion from PDF to other popular
 formats such as: .png; .jpeg; .gif; .odt
 
 Current version: 0.0.1
