### Main Features ### 

In this Module it is possible to generate a PDF with the information of a JSON String.

* **Parsing a JSON String and Returning a PDF** - Using **_iText_** and **_JSON4S_** we're able
to extract all the information given in the JSON String and put it in a PDF document. This is accomplished in
two different steps, the first is to convert the JSON into an HTML file, and the second is to convert the 
resulting HTML file into the desired PDF file.
